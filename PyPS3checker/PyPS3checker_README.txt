Disclaimer:

WARNING: Use this software at your own risk. The author accepts no
responsibility for the consequences of your use of it.


System requirements:
-------------------
 - Any system able to run Python 2.7.x (Windows, Linux, MAC... )
 - Python 2.7.2 or any upper Python 2 version : https://www.python.org
 - (optional to display colored text) Colorama python module

 
Features:
--------
Compatible with any type of PS3 flash memory dump file: 
 - Regular NOR dump (teensy, progskeet, dumps from homebrew, from PS3Xploit)
 - Reversed NOR dump (E3 flasher)
 - Full interleaved NAND dump, PS3Xploit NAND dump
 - EMMC dump from PS3Xploit (still in WIP)
 
Customization of checks and hashs can be done by editing the "checklist.xml" and "hashlist.xml" files.
All initial checks are those from PS3dumpchecker (many thanks at Swizzy), plus a "risklevel" parameter
that can be "WARNING" or "DANGER" like on the BwE validators.

Check log auto-generated as "[mydump].checklog.txt"


Usage:
-----
To display help/commands list, simply run the script without any argument.
 - from windows command prompt: 
        checker.py
 - from Linux/MAC console: 
        ./checker.py
   (under Unix systems, do not forget to set the script as executable using "chmod")

   
Command: 
	checker.py [input_file]

	 [input_file] : Dump filename to check."

	Examples :
	  (windows)
		checker.py mydump.bin  
		checker.py "D:\myfiles\mydump.bin"
	  (unix)
		./checker.py mydump.bin 
		./checker.py /home/username/myfiles/mydump.bin
		
   
Returned exit code:
    0 = checks competed with success. No "WARNING" or "DANGER" found.
    1 = one error occurred (script error, missing file...)
    2 = checks competed with at least a "WARNING" found. No "DANGER" found.
    3 = checks competed with at least a "DANGER" found.
